</head><body>Use CMD when:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.<br/>
<br/>
Use PowerShell when:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When being stealthy is of lesser concern.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If your scripts set and use Aliases.<br/>
